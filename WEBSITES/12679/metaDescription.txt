CDC has one overriding goal: to protect the health of all Americans. At the core of this mission is information sharing â€“ not just health information and disease study results, but information CDC gathers as part of a continuous process of putting information into action. As a science-based agency funded by U.S. taxpayers, CDC is committed to openness and accountability.
