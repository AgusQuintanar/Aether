Religious and Secular Music from the Juan B. Rael Collection
 The array of musical traditions found along el Río Grande del Norte, unique in the Hispanic world, is due to Nuevo México's geographic situation and historic destiny.  From 1598 to 1821, in Spain's most northerly colonial province, colonists were stranded at the very rim of Christendom, a geographic frontier determined by deserts, mountains, and the harsh clime of the northlands.  Their music, especially the heroic, novelesque, and burlesque romances, were necessary inspirations in the daily struggle for survival.   As in other isolated areas of Spain and Latin America, versions of these famous and colorful ballads survived into modern times.  In the lyric vein, the two ancient themes of Eros and Thanatos, love and death, are constantly renewed in the canciones or lyric compositions of each passing generation.  A more enduring repertory of religious music extols the passions of the spirit.
