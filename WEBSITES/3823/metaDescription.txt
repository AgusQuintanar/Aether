The Tecnica Cochise is the first walk mode boot to offer un-compromised downhill performance. Years of intense R & D with constant athlete testing and feedback has led to the evolution of the best in class Cochise collection. Every aspect of the boot’s fit, function and performance has been analyzed and revolutionized to deliver a boot that will take you faster, higher or farther out than you’ve ever been before.
