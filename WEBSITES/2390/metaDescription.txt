Old Pasadena is the business district of Pasadena, a lively and diverse city located just ten miles from downtown Los Angeles. This eclectic old town area features entertainment and activities for kids and adults alike: museums, galleries, and music events as well as movies, shopping, restaurants, and outdoor cafes. Families often stop by after sports events at the Rose Bowl; this clean and safe district is pedestrian friendly and provides ready parking and easy access to public transportation, served by major bus lines and two Gold line metro stops.
