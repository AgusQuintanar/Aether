Renderon completed a full network redesign for Milenio TV in Monterrey, 
Mexico. This was our third time working with the great team from Milenio. 
Milenio Televisi√≥n is a Mexican television cable news channel owned by 
Grupo Multimedios. The news programming uses the resources of the Milenio 
newspaper, one of the largest in the country. Programming is 24 hours a 
day, through news, analysis and specialized programs.
